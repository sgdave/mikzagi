# Review R1

## Purpose
First ever review held as a kick-off meeting.

## Current Status
Desire - Just to create a way to do data collection during vacation and have the house prepped for 4 weeks security wise.

## Long-Term Vision
To be established on the trip, in journal and data entry.

## Goals (Next 4 weeks)
- Goal 1: Figure out what needs to be done for home security over 2 weeks. Give Alok keys? Give neighbours a copy? Remember to move the bin inside.
- Goal 2: Figure out a data entry method/philosophy that will work. KISS. Call it something else, but just put down a lot. Figure out how to sort later, but try to have a sorting methodoly going in.
- Goal 3: Figure out how to bring the family back in the right state of mind, the right mood! They need to learn how to channel their inner Mihir to do justice to the happy memories he's given us. He told me to do so.
